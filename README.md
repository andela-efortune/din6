### Requirements:
max of 3 ships on screen at once
At start of game, 1 ship is added, and then new enemy ship added every 5 seconds until there are 3 ships on the screen - no additional ships are added until one ship is removed

Ship takes 30 seconds to go from top of screen to wall where collision event ends game
Pause button, which pauses whole game (including timer)
Help button, which also pauses game and displays just an alert window with information on how to play game (just input placeholder text, and I will modify this)

Player clicks space ship and is presented with a times tables equation - 1 to 12 times tables e.g. 5 x 5
Needs to input correct answer - alert style window with text input

level 1 - 1 - 4 times tables
level 2 - 5 - 8
level 3 - 9 -12

Correct answer launch rocket which moves toward ship and makes it disappear on collision, with sound effect when enemy ship destroyed

background music - does not need mute control
level timer starts at 60seconds - after 60 seconds if game not over, moves to next level which needs to be inside separate div tag - not separate URL
score starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time answer successfully made

$200
